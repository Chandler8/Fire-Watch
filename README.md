## Future Development

I would love to expand the premise of this to include all ranges of natural disasters and inclement weather. It would also be interesting to provide statistics regarding individual fires, for example being able to present a fire as burning at a lower intensity than other fires. Adding a user login page could be interesting to allow users to save specific natural disasters, perhaps those occuring in their area, to a lighweight database that they could go back and reference from their account.
